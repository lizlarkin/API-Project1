# Couch or COVID | Project 1 - Team Reality-Bytes

"A Data Driven App for Navigating Lockdown with COVID. "

## Concept

This applications gives users a quick glance at the Weather and Covid-19 stats for any city ours user inputs, to see if it was a good idea to venture outside of your home for that day.

## Process

**Technologies used:**

- HTML
- CSS/Foundation
- Javascript/JQuery

**Breakdown of tasks and roles:**

- SCRUM Master - Mike
- HTML/Layout - All
- Styling - Cham/ Mike
- Challenges lended to group coding Javascript - All

## Challenges

**APIs:**

Our COVID API didn't use ZIPCODES and the only "local" data set was county level using FIPS. Since our weather API didn't use FIPS we needed to bring in a 3rd API to convert ZIP to FIPS.

**Timing:**

We ran into timing issues as the COVID API took 1-2s to run, causing the function to "pass" it and not work properly.
